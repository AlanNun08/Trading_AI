# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Gainer Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a **Vue 3 stock monitoring dashboard** that lets users:

- âœ… View the **top gaining stocks** of the day
- âœ… Click a gainer to view its **live news feed**
- âœ… Display a **price chart** for the selected stock
- âœ… View everything on a single, clean dashboard with a responsive layout

The dashboard is powered by live data from **Alpaca** and **Finnhub APIs**, with a frontend built in **Vue 3** and backend integration planned via **Java** for storing and processing stock data.

## ðŸ”§ Features Implemented So Far

- **Top Gainers List**  
  Displays the top gainers of the day using Alpaca's API. Stocks are clickable to load additional data.

- **Stock News Viewer**  
  Fetches and displays today's news headlines for the selected stock using Finnhubâ€™s `company-news` endpoint.

- **Live Price Chart**  
  Renders a daily stock price chart using Chart.js and Finnhubâ€™s candle endpoint.

- **Dynamic Dashboard**  
  All components are modular (gainers, news, chart) and wired together in `DashboardView.vue`. Selecting a stock updates both news and price chart.

- **Router Setup with Navbar**  
  Includes a top navigation bar with links to Home and Stocks, styled with responsive CSS.
