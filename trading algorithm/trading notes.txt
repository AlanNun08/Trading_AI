use api to find stocks that have been the most gainers every day for the last week
	
This is my first strategy
use the stock market api to look for stocks that gain a lot within a day or 3 
then find out that reason
	- is it doing good because of the market doing good
	- is someone inflating those prices
	- did they sign a new contract
	- who did they sign a new contract with
	
do this across different industries
Make sure to record the reason inside of a database
	things to record
		how much time from the time the day starts til the time the stock starts going up
		news- what is the reason
		name of stock
		name of industry
		time and date
		how much is it trading ( how many people are buying and selling ) the whole time it is suppose to go up
		prices - the price it is at before and after the gain
		who is buying
		what orders are entering and leaving the market

	
	I think the reason why the Sidus space stock didn't gain the way I want it to is because I was looking for the 	wrong reason
	Maybe there are other reason for why space stocks/companies/industry gain.
	Like special contracts, who actually gives the company a contract, press releases, 

To Do List:

    Get a list of gainers from fidelity - done
    Get a list of losers from fidelity - done
    look for the reason why the gained or lost
		how I am going to find the reason or reasons why stocks go up
			I am going to need to pull the open/close price, summary, name of ticker, use the dates to join between the stock_data and the news_data
			I need to use the week's data 
				how was the stock behaving through that week
					the behavior for the stock that can be represented by the opening and closing prices\
					what were the news that week
				was there any news leading up to the gain
					what were the news that week
					were there contracts that were offered/signed
				day by day progress
				there must be a average of how much volume moves a day, when that number is exceeded that must mean the stock will go up 
					is this true?
						if it is then find it in the data you have collected
    cross match, see how many of those stocks have things in common 
        did they sign the same contract
        how sensitive is their price compared to the market
            how much do they gain or lose when the markets gains or losers
        do they have the same reason for gaining or losing
        record all of the reasons inside of the database because you will need to use it later when you are paper trading
    create an algorithm for getting Market news so you can have certain news pop up when getting the news
        maybe create a list of keywords

Once I have my strategy I can use it to predict what the insider trades will happen by using the finhub api for that specific date or day
